Introduction:

In this step-by-step tutorial we create a simple MDN Breakout game written entirely in pure JavaScript and rendered on HTML5 <canvas>.

You will learn the basics of using the <canvas> element to implement fundamental game mechanics like rendering and moving images, collision detection, 
control mechanisms, and winning and losing states.

To get the most out of this series of articles you should already have basic to intermediate JavaScript knowledge. 
After working through this tutorial you should be able to build your own simple Web games.

The above image is a Gameplay screen from the game MDN Breakout where you can use your paddle to bounce the ball and destroy the brick field, with keeping
the score and lives.

9. Mouse controls
10. Finishing up

Starting with pure JavaScript is the best way to get a solid knowledge of web game development.
After that, you can pick any framework you like and use it for your projects. 
Frameworks are just tools built with the JavaScript language; so even if you plan on working with them, it's good to learn about the language itself first to
know what exactly is going on under the hood. 
Frameworks speed up development time and help take care of boring parts of the game, but if something is not working as expected, you can always try to debug 
that or just write your own solutions in pure JavaScript.
