# An Introduction to mobile game development.
In this step-by-step tutorial we create a simple 'Breakout' game written entirely in pure JavaScript and rendered on HTML5 <canvas>.
  
You will learn the basics of using the <canvas> element to implement fundamental game mechanics like rendering and moving images, collision detection, control mechanisms, and winning and losing states.

## REMEMBER:
It's important to read the docs before proceeding to look at the code.

The game development is partitioned into 10 steps.

1. Create the Canvas and draw on it
2. Move the ball
3. Bounce off the walls
4. Paddle and keyboard controls
5. Game over
6. Build the brick field
7. Collision detection
9. Track the score and win
9. Mouse controls
10. Finishing up
